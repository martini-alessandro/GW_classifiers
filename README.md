## The problem 
Gravitational waves detector are very sensitive instruments to detect gravitational waves.\\
The problem with these detectors and analysis pipelines is that a lot of triggers are produced during
an analysis, and distinguishing between genuine signals and noise transients is a problem yet to be 
completely solved. \\ 
Machine Learning Algorithms are advanced tools that allow to perform highly accurate classifications,
the aim of this repo-project is to build different ML classifiers to maximise the capacity of distinguishing
between genuine signals and noise. \\ 
The data used are the triggers produced by the coherent WaveBurst [1] pipeline, together with its features.\\ 
These features are recombined to create predictive features to train different models that are tested on 
a set of noise instances VS signal instances which are buil via proper simulations. \\
